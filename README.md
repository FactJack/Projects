# Welcome to my lessons & studies!
This repository is a space to store projects I've dedictated time to, simply for the sake of learning. 

### China & US GDP Projections
Began as a exploration of CodeCademy's life expectancy and GDP data. Ended with a model and projection of when China's GDP will surpass the U.S., judging from IMF historical data.

### HurricaneAnalysis
A different solution to The Hurricane Analysis from Code Academy
My initial solution, starting at #2, was to define a function to be used recurringly regardless if the keys were to change. 

### US Medical Insurance Costs
Here I explore what I remember about statistics. 

### Cleaning US Sensus Data
Practicing some lessons from Codecademy's Data Science foundations course. 

#### Study Ideas:
 - Update China & US GDP model for inflation. Locate sources for a recurring model. Refine code for consistent reports.
